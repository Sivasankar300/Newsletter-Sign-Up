### About this project:
It is a dummy mock up Sign-up form focused on deepening one's knowledge of HTML-based form vaildation and Form styling.
The prior lessons focuses on the reasons to use cilent side form vaildation alongside server-side vaildation
as the former can be easily bypassed to prevent invailds from being stored on the database.

They also covered how forms can be made accessible for disabled persons through use of tags such as fieldset, legends, id and
the proper structure to use these effectively in to assist them in the best way possible.
